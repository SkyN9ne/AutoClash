## "Fair Play" initiative
On April 17, 2016, SuperCell warned users they will be banned for use of "Third Party Software" (http://supercell.com/en/safe-and-fair-play/). This includes Hacks, “mods”, “Bots”, automation, scripts, or any other programs that aim to modify or provide unearned progress. Device emulators and rooted devices are allowed.

Authough AutoClash is difficult to detect, you are advised that your use of this product is a direct violation of the SuperCell TOS (http://supercell.com/en/terms-of-service/).
